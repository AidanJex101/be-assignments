My app is made for an online pokemon database that hosts many users. 
It stores pokemon and the ongoing battles that are occuring between those pokemon. 
It can be extended far beyond just what I did here but its in its most basic form. 

I learned many things during my backend course. 
I had to learn a new database language of Postgresql. 
I also got to learn 3 new python modules used for making datatbases. 
These are flask, sql_alchemy, and marshmallow.
This allowed me to make the database i made for my capstone. 
It was a lot to learn but I had a ton of fun doing it.

My favorite part of this class was making this here database.
Its fun to be able to put what you learn into practice with something you enjoy.
In this case I used it for my love of videogames and made a database that represents that.
If I had to do the database on something else it would be related to Super Mario 64 which is a game I speedrun.
